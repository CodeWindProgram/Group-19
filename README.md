## Problem Statement :-



# To develop a Assignment module page 
#The info on how we created the front-end
hi, I  IamHarsh02 -patareharsh@gmail.com
 Before uploading  the final pages for our module , I did the following tasks:
 *Made a front-end of students dashboard where the new assignments will be visible when students click on dashboard in navbar 
 view assigment button will be there where students  have to click on view assignmnets and assignment file will be downloaded .  
 *did the same for faculty  when they click on dashboard the subject teacher can upload assignments .
 also created the upload assigment form for stduents to upload the assigmnets form  *which  will be visible when students click on upload assignment button 
*created an atractive home page for students & faculty.

@BhaveshPujari- bhaveshpujari2000@gmail.com         I created  attractive  progrees pages for students & faculty members .
*students progrees will be vissible in % format  and the same will be visible for faculty 
the students progress page will display when students /faculy click on  students progrees button  present on dashboard

@praticksonawane  - praticksonawane@ternaengg.ac.in  I Created the student submission page which will be visble only to faculty 
*the student submission page consist of names of students and there status= submited/Not submited 
this will only display when faculty member logs on to the page 

@AtharvPande   - I Created the database back-end part in postgreessql
i installed postgreessql on my pc and created the schema 
created the tables for students and faculty 
designed the foreign key  for our module and disscused the final design of our pages on the bases of this @IamHarsh created the pages 

#Things we Installed to make this react js module 
1.NODE JS 
2.React VERSION ^17.0.2
3.Bootstrap ^5.0.2"
4.Visual Studio Code as text editor
5.postgreessql


##Issue with  our Module:
Although  Less people contributed in our  module we did whatever we could do
we dont know how to link pages to database  so we did our best to create static pages.
so far we did the front-end part .
